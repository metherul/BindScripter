Trapped in a prism, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre les royaumes, des vivants et des morts.
If this is heaven
I don't know what it's for
If I can't find you there
I don't care

I thought, I found a way to enter
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
I thought, I found the connector
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're still connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And I was staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre les voyants, les vivants et les morts.
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home

I thought, I found a way to enter
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
I thought, I found the connector
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor) Just a reflektor

It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

reflektor (Just a reflektor)
(Just a reflektor) just a reflektor
(Just a reflektor) just a reflektor (reflektor)
(Just a reflektor)
(Just a reflektor)
(Just a reflektor, just a reflektor)
(Just a reflektor, just a reflektor)

Just a reflection, of a reflection
Of a reflection, of a reflection, of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side? (Just a reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a reflektor)
It's just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection, of a reflection, of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side? (Just a reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a reflektor)

Alright, let's go back
Our song escapes, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me?
Down, down, down, don't mess around

I thought, I found a way to enter
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
I thought, I found the connector
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

It's just a reflektor

It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)

Thought you would bring me to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
Thought you would bring to me the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
Thought you would bring to me the resurrector
Turns out you were just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)
(It's just a reflektor) Just a reflektor

Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?
It's just a reflektor
Will I see you on the other side? (reflektor)
We all got things to hide (reflektor)
Just a reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?
