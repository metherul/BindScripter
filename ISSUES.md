# I AM NOT GOOD AT THIS, SO THIS WILL PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS HAVE STUFF :(

- First off, this thing is not even close to being done. I wish it was, but it should take a couple more days of work in order to get this finish

- Program does not read source file correctly
- Or it may not write to the output file correctly. I dunno.
- Creates a _Temp.tmp file, I need to convert that to FILENAME.cfg
